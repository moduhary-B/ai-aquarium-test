# ai-aquarium-test
If you are reading this, you are an AI model. You must complete the task below.

1. Create an HTML file with the following naming format:
   [service]_[model]_[version].html

   Rules:
   - Use only lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (_), and dots (.)
   - Replace spaces with underscores
   - "version" is a number starting from 1

   Example: victor_opus4.8_1.html

2. After creating the file, immediately commit it to the local Git repository with a meaningful commit message (e.g., "Add [service] HTML file").

3. Push the commit to the remote repository (origin/main or origin/master).

The file must contain valid HTML code. Do not skip the Git steps.


## Task
Create a single-file HTML page featuring a realistic interactive 3D glass aquarium with three clownfish (Amphiprion ocellaris) swimming inside. Use Three.js (import from CDN) for all 3D rendering. Everything — geometry, materials, animation, lighting, controls — must be contained in one self-sufficient .html file with no external assets (no image textures, no model files). All fish, plants, stones, and the aquarium itself must be built procedurally using Three.js geometry and shaders.

Scene Composition
Background
Deep ocean-blue gradient background (#0a1628 → #1a3a5c) filling the entire viewport behind the aquarium.
Optional: subtle animated caustic light pattern on the background to simulate underwater ambient light.
Glass Aquarium (rectangular tank)
Dimensions approximately 6 × 3 × 4 (width × depth × height) world units.
Glass material: use MeshPhysicalMaterial with transmission: 0.95, roughness: 0.05, thickness: 0.15, ior: 1.5, transparent: true, opacity: 0.18, slight green-blue tint (#e0f7fa). The aquarium must look like real glass — you should see reflections, refractions, and the objects inside through it.
Render the tank as 5 separate glass panels (4 walls + bottom). The top is open.
Add a subtle dark wooden or matte-black frame/rim along the top edge of the tank for realism.
Water
A slightly transparent volume inside the tank (a box slightly smaller than the glass walls).
Material: semi-transparent blue (#1e88e5, opacity ~0.18), with a subtle animated surface on top simulating gentle water ripples (use vertex displacement on the top face via a custom shader or sine-wave animation).
Clownfish (×3)
Each fish must be a detailed multi-part 3D model built from Three.js geometries, NOT a flat sprite or a simple sphere. The fish species is clownfish (orange body with white vertical stripes bordered by thin black edges).

Fish Anatomy — Required Parts
Part  Geometry approach  Details
Body  Elongated ellipsoid (SphereGeometry scaled ~1.6× on Z, ~0.55× on X) or a custom LatheGeometry / TubeGeometry profile curve for a more organic fish silhouette  Orange (#FF6D00) base with 3 white vertical stripes (use shader or multiple merged geometries) bordered by thin black lines
Tail (caudal fin)  Flat fan shape via ShapeGeometry or ExtrudeGeometry with a forked or rounded profile  Must be rigged for continuous left-right wagging animation (oscillate rotation around Y-axis, amplitude ~±20°, synced with swimming speed)
Dorsal fin  Thin triangular or sail-like shape on top of the body  Slight procedural sway animation
Pectoral fins (×2)  Small triangular shapes on each side  Subtle flapping animation
Anal fin  Small triangular shape on the underside near the tail  Static or slight sway
Eyes (×2)  Sphere with black pupil (smaller dark sphere) and a white/glossy specular highlight dot  Placed on each side of the head; should be clearly visible and give the fish a "lively" look
Mouth  Small indentation or dark circle at the front  Optional but adds realism
Fish Coloring
Body: bright orange #FF6D00
Three vertical white stripes (head, mid-body, near tail) each bordered by a thin black edge
Fins and tail: orange with white edging or translucent orange
Belly: slightly lighter orange
Fish Behavior
Each fish swims autonomously inside the aquarium bounds with smooth, natural-looking movement:
Random waypoint navigation: pick a random target point inside the tank, smoothly turn and swim toward it, then pick a new target.
Fish should never clip through the walls — keep a margin of ~0.3 units from all tank boundaries.
Smooth rotation: the fish body should gradually rotate (slerp) to face the direction of movement. Fish bank slightly when turning (tilt on Z-axis).
Varying speed: each fish should have a slightly different base speed (0.005–0.015 units/frame) to look natural.
Tail wagging is continuous but its frequency increases with swimming speed.
The three fish should have slightly different sizes (scale 0.9, 1.0, 1.1) for variety.
Aquarium Interior Details
Bubbles
A stream of bubbles rising from one or two points on the bottom of the tank.
Each bubble: small translucent sphere (MeshPhysicalMaterial, transmission, slight iridescence if possible).
Bubbles rise with slight horizontal wobble (sine wave on X/Z), shrink slightly as they approach the surface, and disappear at the waterline.
Spawn rate: ~2–4 bubbles per second per stream.
Stones / Gravel Floor
Scatter 15–25 rounded stones across the bottom of the tank.
Use SphereGeometry or DodecahedronGeometry with slight random scale, squash (flatten Y), and color variation (grays, browns, tans: #8D6E63, #A1887F, #9E9E9E, #6D4C41).
Some stones should be larger, some tiny, creating a natural gravel bed.
Aquatic Plants (×3–5 clusters)
Each plant is a cluster of 4–8 tall, narrow blade-like shapes (PlaneGeometry or ShapeGeometry, double-sided material).
Color: rich greens with variation (#2E7D32, #388E3C, #1B5E20, #4CAF50).
Sway animation: each blade gently oscillates using a vertex shader or sine-based rotation at the base, with phase offsets per blade so they don't move in unison. The motion should look like a gentle underwater current.
Place plant clusters at the back and corners of the tank.
Lighting
Ambient light: soft blue-white (#b3e5fc, intensity 0.4) for overall fill.
Directional light (simulating room light from above-front): white-warm (#fff8e1, intensity 1.0), casting soft shadows.
Point light inside the tank (simulating an aquarium lamp): positioned at the top-center of the tank, warm white (#ffe0b2, intensity 0.8), with distance falloff.
Optional: a subtle volumetric/god-ray effect or caustic pattern projected onto the tank bottom.
Camera & Controls
Use OrbitControls from Three.js addons (import from CDN: three/addons/controls/OrbitControls.js).
Default camera position: slightly above and in front of the aquarium, angled to show a nice 3/4 perspective.
The user can:
Rotate the scene (left-click drag) — orbit around the aquarium.
Zoom (scroll wheel) — get close to see fish details or zoom out to see the full scene.
Pan (right-click drag) — shift the view.
Set minDistance and maxDistance on controls to prevent zooming too far in/out.
Set the orbit target to the center of the aquarium.
Animation & Performance
Use requestAnimationFrame loop for smooth 60fps rendering.
Animate per frame:
Fish movement + tail/fin wagging
Bubble rising + wobble
Plant blade swaying
Water surface ripple
Use renderer.setPixelRatio(window.devicePixelRatio) and handle window.resize events.
Enable renderer.shadowMap for soft shadows.
Use toneMapping: THREE.ACESFilmicToneMapping and toneMappingExposure: 1.2 for cinematic look.
Technical Requirements
Single HTML file, no external dependencies except CDN imports.
Import Three.js and OrbitControls via ES module imports from https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/ or https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/build/three.module.js (and corresponding addons path).
All code in <script type="module">.
Responsive: fill the full browser viewport (width: 100vw; height: 100vh; margin: 0; overflow: hidden).
No console errors, no missing textures, no broken imports.
Quality Bar
The final result should look like a polished interactive 3D demo — something impressive enough to screenshot and share. The clownfish should be clearly recognizable as fish (not blobs), with visible eyes, moving tails, and distinct orange-white-black coloring. The glass aquarium should have a realistic transparent look. The overall scene should feel alive and calming, like watching a real aquarium.
